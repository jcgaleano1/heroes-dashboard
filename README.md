Hi, thanks for watching this project, I am Johan Galeano

In this project I want to show some information that is being showed by charts. You can also verify some cards with some data, after that you can review the statistics of each superhero or you can view the general charts from all data.

This project was developed with technologies such as React, React router dom, recharts and file saver. Also with a personal api uploaded to jsonserver
